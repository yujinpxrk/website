Styling & Customizations: I used the Open Sans font to give the website a consistent, modern appearance, and applied 
box-sizing: border-box to simplify layout calculations. To start with a clean design, I set default margin and padding 
to zero across all elements. For the body, I chose a white background with dark text, using a line height 
of 1.6 for smooth readability. The header features a dark background with light text and I added padding
 for better spacing and a bottom border for clear visual separation. Also, I customized the typography to 
create a clear hierarchy, with centered h1 headings and adjusted h2 sizes for consistency. 

The navigation bar uses flexbox for a centered, evenly spaced layout, and the links have smooth color 
transitions on hover to indicate interactivity. Sections like .intro and .about are centered, with padding, 
rounded corners, and I ensured consistent margins to maintain proper spacing. Images are styled as 
circular, with a hover zoom effect to add a dynamic feel, and they are responsive, resizing appropriately 
on smaller screens.

For lists, I opted for square bullets for a straightforward look, adding custom styles to the .awards-list to 
enhance readability and line spacing. The footer maintains the same dark theme as the header, with 
padded spacing and links that change color on hover for visual consistency. Finally, I used media 
queries to keep the layout user-friendly.
